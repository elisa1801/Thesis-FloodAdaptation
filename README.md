# Thesis-FloodAdaptation
This repository is created for my master thesis project at TU Delft. It considers the analysis of trust in flood information and its influence on the intention to take private flood adaptation measures. 

## Project set-up
This repository contains multiple notebooks and follows a stepwise approach to answer the following research question: How does trust in information on floods and flood adaptation influence the intention to take private flood adaptation measures in flood-prone areas in the United Kingdom? The data is based on survey data from three areas in the United Kingdom. The code has been written in JupyterLab.

## Installation
This code requires Python version 3.11.11. The project requires packages to be installed, see the requirements.txt file. 

## Usage
This project contains a stepwise approach of running the notebooks. First, the Step0Datapreparation notebooks needs to be run as it generates csv files for use in other notebooks. Then, the other Step0 notebooks can be run, followed by Step 1, 2 and 3. 

The survey data uploaded to the repository is a public mini batch. This will therefore not yield the same figures and results as the generated notebooks uploaded on the repository, but it shows how the code can be run based on the data. 

## Features
These notebooks include features such as descriptive analysis techniques (Step1), binary logistic regressions (Step2) and K-Medoids clustering (Step3).
