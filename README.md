# Thesis-FloodAdaptation
This repository is created for my master thesis project at TU Delft. It considers the analysis of trust in flood information and its influence on the intention to take private flood adaptation measures. 

## Project set-up
This repository contains multiple notebooks and follows a stepwise approach to answer the following research question: How does trust in information on floods and flood adaptation influence the intention to take private flood adaptation measures in flood-prone areas in the United Kingdom? The data is based on survey data from three areas in the United Kingdom. The code has been written in JupyterLab.
