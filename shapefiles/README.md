# Additional explanation data
This shapefile folder should originally contain two folders with two different shapefile data. However, this repository only includes one batch of data in the folder: statistical-gis-boundaries-london. This is the data from the Statistical GIS Boundary files from the Greater London Authority (geodata), found on the following link: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/

Another folder, UK_plot must be created containing the shapefile data found here: https://statistics.ukdataservice.ac.uk/dataset/2011-census-geography-boundaries-middle-layer-super-output-areas-and-intermediate-zones. Only then can the code be properly run.
